# Mitigating Gender Bias in Machine Translation: Target Language Grammatical Gender Projections Onto Source Language
Repository contains code and partial data for experiments described in [Mitigating Gender Bias in Machine Translation: Target Language Grammatical Gender Projections Onto Source Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06203)

__This research has been supported by the European Regional Development Fund within the joint project of SIA TILDE and University of Latvia “Multilingual Artificial Intelligence Based Human Computer Interaction” No. 1.1.1.1/18/A/148.__

### Requirements
Conda is recommended way to run experiments `conda create -n gender-bias python=3.7`. <br>
Also make sure you have system-wide dependencies `sudo apt install build-essential swig python-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev libsparsehash-dev`.<br>
Then switch into conda environment and install necessary tools via `scripts/install_tools.sh`.

### Running experiments
Experiments are organized per language pair (training corpora).<br>
Running bash scripts in order from `scripts/{language}/*.sh` will prepare data, train model and evaluate BLEU and WinoMT scores.
Experiments for `latvian_imba` (large proprietary Tilde corpora) are not reproducible.<br>
Each language pair trains 2 NMT systems baseline(base) with no TGA and gendered(genders2) with TGA in training data. 

### Evaluation results
Evaluation metrics are aggregated in 
`evaluation_logs/{languate}/{experiment}/`.<br>
WinoMT test set translations are stored in 
`data/wino_mt/{langage}/{experiment}`.<br>
Newstest translations can be found in `data/dev_translations/{language}/{experiment}`.

### Scripts
Paper-specific data preparation scripts can be found in `scripts/python`. Example usage can be found in `scripts/common/` where these scripts are invoked.
- `generate_genders.py` extracts gender annotations (M/F/N/U) using `Stanza` tagger
- `align_genders.py`  projects target gender annotations onto source side tokens
- `genders_bpe.py` copy word level gender annotations to their respective sub-word parts
- `randomly_include_genders.py` applies dropout to TGA
- `wino_mt_genders.py` extract gold gender annotations from WinoMT dataset
- `wino_mt_genders_allen.py` generate gender annotations using AllenNLP coreference resolution tool
